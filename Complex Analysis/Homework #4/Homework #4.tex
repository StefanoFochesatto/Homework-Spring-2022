\section*{Exercises 2.2}

\begin{exercise}{7} Decide whether each of the following sequences converges, and if so, find its limit.\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[d.] $z_n = \dfrac{n(2+i)}{n+1}$\\
        \solution Consider the sequence, after we divide both terms in fraction by $n$, 
        \begin{align*}
            z_n &= \dfrac{n(2+i)}{n+1},\\
            &= \dfrac{\frac{n(2+i)}{n}}{\frac{n+1}{n}},\\
            &= \dfrac{(2+i)}{\frac{n+1}{n}}.
        \end{align*}
        This gives us that the limit as $n \to \infty$ is 
        \begin{equation*}
            \lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = \dfrac{(2+i)}{\frac{n+1}{n}} = 2 + i. 
        \end{equation*}
        \vspace{.15in}
        
        


        \item[e.] $z_n = \left(\dfrac{1 - i}{4}\right)^n$\\
        \solution 
 
    \end{enumerate}
